                   I am a self acknowledged geek. I enjoy video games, board games, 
                     Dungeons and Dragons ( I know you had no idea), reading, and writing.
                     My hobbies are very geeky (more on that <a href = "https://www.google.com" target = "blank">here</a>)  
                     I like <em>geeky</em> things so it's no surprise really that I found <a href = "https://www.purelybranded.com/insights/web-design-or-web-development-whats-the-difference/" 
                   target ="blank">        Web development and Design </a> 
                       to be very interesting. <br> <br>
                       I 
                     have been self teaching myself web design related coding. I have gone 
                     through HTML, CSS, and Java Script with JQuery. I have alot to learn 
                     still but I'm enjoying what I've learned so far. I've created this webpage
                     to be my virtual playground if you will where I can express my various 
                     interests and explore web design and development through the creation of 
                     it. The great thing is that life is ever changing so as I learn new things 
                     and grow and develop this website can too! So come, play with me!
